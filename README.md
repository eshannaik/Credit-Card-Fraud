# Credit-Card-Fraud

#### This project was dont on google Colab.
#### Dataset for this project was got from kaggle.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### The main objective of this project is to predict Credit Card Fraud using Autoencoders and Losgistic Regression.
#### This project consists of a Encoder made up of 2 Dense Layers and a Decoder made up of 2 Dense layers
#### The project also consists of a few visualizations using TSNE.
#### The libraries that have been used are :
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Keras
    Tensorflow
    Sklearn
    
#### The Keras models that have been used are :
    keras.models (Model,Sequential)
    keras.layers (Dense, Input)
    tensorflow.keras (regularizers)
    
#### The sklearn models that have been used are :
    manifold (TSNE)
    peprocessing (MinMaxScaler)
    model_selection (train_test_split)
    linear_model (Logistic Regression)
    metrics (classification report,accuracy_score)

#### The final accuracy achieved on the Logistic Regression is 90.63 %
